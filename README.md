Introduction:

Introduce the purpose of the live coding demo: to showcase the implementation of a hero section for a website using React.
Preparation:

Ensure that you have access to the sample output images provided on GitHub.
Have a React project set up and ready for demonstration.
Objective:

Implement a hero section with overlapping images and styled text content.
Step-by-Step Implementation:

HTML Structure:

Create a functional component named HeroPage.
Within the component, create a div with a class of hero-container to contain the hero section.
Image Placement:

Import the main car image (main-car.png) and set it as the main hero image using an img tag with the class main-car.
Import the hero background image (hero-bg.png) and position it using an img tag with the class hero-bg.
Text Content:

Add a div with the class text-content to contain the text content.
Inside the text-content div, add an h3 tag with the text "Plan your trip now".
Add an h1 tag with the text "Save big with our car rental".
Include a p tag with the text "Rent the car of your dreams. Unbeatable prices, unlimited miles, flexible pick-up options and much more."
Styling:

Use CSS to style the hero section and text content.
Set the font family to "Poppins" for the text content.
Adjust the positioning and z-index of the images and text content to achieve the desired layout.
Increase the font size of the text content for better readability.
